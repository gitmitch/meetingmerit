# MeetingMerit.com Source Code

This is the source code for <http://meetingmerit.com>

It's a node.js application (should work on both 0.10 and 0.12).

Uses a SQL database back-end.

For the node.js app, you need to set some environment variables. See the mm_modules/db.js file.

You can find a SQL export of an empty database in the sql directory.
